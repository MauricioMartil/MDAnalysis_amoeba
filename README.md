# MDAnalysis_amoeba

For the scripts you need a pdb of your structure and the arc file with the xyz suffix. Once you have those all the labels for the residues will be the same as the pdb.

To use the scripts, you need the MDAnalysis library (a quick pip install mdanalysis) and I used the version of python3.9.
